        <p>Hey welcome to my personal website. My name is Simon I am currently at CodeNation doing a 3 week course learning about python, HTML, CSS and other languages.
        So far I am enjoying learning new things and making new friends at CodeNation. One of the most enjoyable project done so far is making a text based adventure
        game in python within groups. For this website I will be experimenting around with HTML and CSS.
        <br>

        <br>A little bit more about my background is that I graduated with a degree in games art which focuses on 3D modelling using industries standard software such as 
        3DSMax, Maya, Mudbox, Substance Painter and many others. After graduating I took another course in AWS re/Start by Generations UK which focuses on cloud technology.
        So I had a little bit of experience in coding (mainly python and using linux machines) although still quite a beginner in it. Upon completing the course I gained
        a Cloud Practitioneer certification. To further upskill I took the opportunity to develop my coding skills a bit more through CodeNation.
