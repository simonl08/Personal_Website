                <p>One of my main hobbies is playing games mainly on PC at the moment but also consoles too from time to time. I pretty much grew up playing games. One of the 
                first online games I played was 'Adventure quest', 'RuneScape' and 'World of Warcraft' in the early 2000s. This led up to RTS style games such as 'The Lord of the Rings: 
                The Battle for Middle-earth' and also 'StarCraft'. Then I pretty much got into MMORPG's again with Guild Wars 2, Black Desert Online and revisiting previous MMO's again. 
                I do play a variety of different games rather than just sticking to one but depends on what I feel like doing honestly. Some examples of other games I play are single player
                games like 'The Witcher' franchise, dark souls (probably one of my favourite franchise), your standard fps games and some JRPG.</p>

            <p>My other hobbies is watching TV series, movies and anime. During my spare time if I have nothing to do I enjoy finding any new or old tv series to watch and one of my favourites
                is 'The Office' US version, it is a sitcom that shows the daily lives of office employees and has many great characters. Highly recommend!. As for movies I really like the fantasy
                genre and 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy is probably one of my favourites easily because I find the middle earth universe and lore quite intresting. With animes I enjoy watching
                ghibli movies and series in general. I enjoy watching many different types whether it's adventure, sports, slice of anime, shonen etc. Nothing in particular that I prefer, if I 
                see something and like it, I'll continue watching, simple as.

            <div class="hobbiesText">
            <p>Reading manga/webtoons/manhwa is another hobby of mine. Kinda similar to reading comic books I guess but in a different style. For mangas I pretty much have the same mindset,
                if I enjoy reading something I like it, no preference really. The images above just shows some of the mangas/webtoons that I enjoy reading (from left to right Solo leveling,
                Berserk and My hero academia). But if I were to recommend to read something to start off then I'll probably suggest reading Solo Leveling since it is one of the most hyped
                on-going series right now.

            <p>As for music I enjoy listening to all sorts of music such as pop, rock, rap. But at the moment I enjoy listening to K-hip-hop (korean hip hop) since I like the beats and also how 
                they sound in general. For artists I'd recommend checking out Changmo 'Meteor', The Quiett 'Orange remix'and Nafla 'Wu'. I'm not really following any western music at the moment but I do 
                listen from time to time. I enjoy a lot of the old punk rock music from bands such as Red Chilli Hot Peppers, Sum41, My Chemical Romance, The Offspring and many others. I also 
                really enjoy most music from the 80s such as Fleetwood Mac 'Everywhere', Aha 'Take on me' and a lot more.
